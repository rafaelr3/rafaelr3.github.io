<p><strong>Rethinking Theological Imagination</strong></p>
<p>This seminar will look at the theological imagination, here defined as the space and force by which images and concepts of God are formed or understood. We will look at the axial shifts of thought which affect the Theological imagination in its medieval, modern and contemporary stages. We will discuss some of the components of Process thought and how it challenges or rethinks the theological imagination for our current time.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Pluralism, Truth and the Pluralist Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Religious Diversity is an actual fact and can also be a problem.  It is an actual fact because of what we experience in the complex reality of our world; it is a problem because of the interaction between religions, but more importantly, because of the interactions, and thus implications within religions.  The discussion of the manyness of religions lead to questions of the validity of religious truth: is it inclusive or exclusive? Who holds the ultimate truth?  But a more important question is involved: is religious diversity welcomed?  If so, is it to be accepted as an aspect of reality, or as an ideal that we move towards?</p>
<p>This class will investigate diverse ways of describing and discussing the plurality and unity of religions by viewing it through the Pluralist Imagination, which maintains the position of relativity and plurality of truths.  We will also look at the paths of salvation/liberation, how the unity of religions can be conceptualized through a world theology.</p>
<p><strong>World Religions: Diversity, Unity, and Dialogue</strong></p>
<p>This course is an introduction to several of the world&rsquo;s religious traditions &ndash; the Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Baha’i traditions. We will focus on some writings in each tradition, asking the following questions: How do adherents in each tradition articulate the central symbols, tenets, and practices of their faith in the context of the questions and challenges of the modern world? How do people in each tradition think about their own faith in the light of the diversity of other religious traditions? Is religious diversity and difference a problem? The Goal of the course is 1) to develop the ability to think both empathetically and critically about diverse religious claims, 2) to gain knowledge of the history and culture of several major religious traditions, and 3) to begin to think of methods to engage in unity and dialogue</p>
<p><strong>Eco-theology: The God/World Relationship</strong></p>
<p>Eco-theology is a radical rethinking of theology, not only describing the God/human relationship but the God/world relationship.  It moves from otherness (I and thou separated) to a world of intertwining, evolving relationships, and sustainability. This course will provide a foundation in eco-theology (within Process Thought and Christian Theology) as a way of rethinking theological commitments in light of our current ecological crisis that requires a concrete lived response.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Theology</strong></p>
<p>Theology means God-talk.  But how can we talk about God?  How can we talk about an event (God) that is experienced, but that experience is felt and understood intuitively and phenomenologically, and only afterwards intellectually? In that experience, how do we begin to reflect upon the world around us, specifically in the current events that make one wonder “where is God?”  In the pursuit of seeking a response, we also seek to understand the ultimate mystery which we call God, as well as God’s interaction in the world, and our call to walk with the divine.</p>
<p>By engaging various readings in cultural, contextual, and philosophical fields, this course will “seek understanding” (<em>fides quaerens intellectum</em>) of these questions by exploring the variety of Christian understandings of God, God’s relation to the world, Christ, the Spirit, Trinity, creation, the intercultural and interreligious contexts of the church, and the quest for God’s kingdom-to-come. The class encourages students to address these topics in relation to contemporary intellectual, cultural, ethical, social, and political issues, as well as its application to practical and ministerial situations.</p>
<p><strong>Queer Theologies</strong></p>
<p>This course is an introduction that explores the aims and methods of queer theology. &ldquo;Queer&rdquo; theology transgresses and subverts dominant constructions of sexuality and gender identity, reinterpreting and reconstructing expressions of Christian thought and practice that forces one to rethink understandings of human life, community, and the divine.  We will explore queer approaches to theology and biblical interpretation, especially where notions of identity (esp. gender and sex, but also race, ethnicity, class, ability) are concerned. We will also look at arguments, as well as look beyond, concerning the inclusion of sexual minorities into Christian communities. In this course, we will learn to engage in &ldquo;queering&rdquo; Christian theology and biblical interpretation to inquire about the benefits and usefulness of queer theory as a tool for constructive theological projects and Christian practices.</p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to introduce Eco-theology, a radical rethinking of theology that speaks of the God/World/Human relationship as a world of intertwining, evolving relationships, and sustainability. The course looks at significant themes such as God and the World, Economy, Ecology, Creation, Humanity, and Animal and Land as Sacred.  We will also introduce and seek to engage with the environmental crises of our time and place, and seek justice for all creatures. The movement toward radical action can only be possible if there is also a radical transformation of our hearts and minds.</p>

<h2 id="doctoral-level-courses">Doctoral Level Courses</h2>
<p><strong>Critical Interpretation Seminar</strong></p>
<p>The Critical Interpretation Seminar is one makes use of philosophical and religious tools of the discipline of hermeneutics to organize its approach.  Hermeneutics can be broadly defined as the practice of interpretation of texts.  What is a text will be one of our initial key questions.  The seminar will start by looking at the performative dimensions of a text, with special attention to the manner in which reading, studying, and learning are performed human activities, or practices.</p>
<p>To this end the seminar is designed to assist candidates over the first year to provide an opportunity to engage in critical and performative reflection and interpretation of texts and contexts, with special attention to the manner in which reflection and interpretation are a practice of ministry in community, to assist in developing critical interpretive skills drawing upon several academic disciplines in a global urban context, to explore the interrelationships of religious faith, experience, knowledge, analysis, and action that texts (including the text of one’s own life and the text of performed ministries) generate in a global urban context, that is, in the context of difference, and to experience personal and professional growth in a global urban context, working with instructor and fellow students as peers.</p>
