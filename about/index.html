<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>
<p>Dr. Rafael Reyes III’ courses focuses on the areas of process philosophy, theology, post-structuralist thought, religious pluralism and technology.  Some of the courses he teaches are on the Theological Imagination, Eco-Theology, and Constructive Theology. Dr. Reyes is also the co-editor of the <a href="http://www.psupress.org/Journals/jnls_JOWC.html">Journal of World Christianity</a> which is concerned with comparative studies of both local forms of Christianity in the areas in which it has historically existed or presently exists, and with the place of Christianity in inter-religious dialogue. Dr. Reyes’ dissertation is entitled, “Open Receptacles: Imagination in Continental and Process Thought, and the Opening of Religious Pluralism,” where he explores the roles of both imagination and relationality in discussions on religious pluralism and dialogue.</p>
<h3 id="on-process-imagining">On Process Imagining</h3>
<p>Process Imagining concerns itself with aesthetic forms of truth that harmonizes logic and coherence, adequacy and applicability.  It holds to a speculative philosophy that begins with the most concrete form of experience, and not solely from general ideas. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Truth is not the ground where we begin but part of a process for a lure for feeling.  In the process of this lure for feeling, what is pertinent is free imaginative generalization, which is the removal of truth so possibilities can have their way.  Without imagination, it becomes difficult to move beyond repetition, repetition in choosing between options.  Imagination shows us how many different worlds can harmonize and create something that is novel. But this also introduces another aspect about truth: Truth, becomes applicable to a specific event, but not for all events. If life is not about truth but rather lure for feeling (we are feeling entities), what is important are propositions, inquiries, adventure, imagination.  Thus process imagining.</p>
<p>If I understand thinkers such as William James, Alfred North Whitehead, Henry Bergson, Gottfried Liebniz and Gilles Deleuze correctly, or at least in their trajectory, all of life is a process, about relationality.  Thus, every category of our existence comes into question since the world around us (and by world I mean the virtual world that begins with economics, capitalism, etc) is based on a substance based metaphysics, a metaphysics not on relationality or process, but substance-ness, thing-ness.</p>
<p>The systems that are established and “make the world turn” are not the systems we use in our more concrete lives, and by concrete lives I mean the real lives we live in our most intimate of spaces.  Each system (philosophy, religion, economics, sociology, etc.) tries to generalize and at the same time try to contain a “perfect dictionary” in how to describe the way the world works.  But we cannot contain all the ideas applicable to experience because each new experience breaks down prior ideas as containing all of experience.  Process forces and enforces a new analyzation of experience, thus creating a whole new world of possibilities.  Complexity at its greatest. Thus what needs to be done is to neither marginalize nor alienate other experiences, but to learn from them, grow, and expand on the events as they creatively form new concepts.  There can never be a general set of ideas so as to cover the basis of all experience, thus the categories of philosophy, religion economics, etc., will burst at its seams.  They too need to be rethought, expounded upon, expanded.</p>
<p>The rethinking I am doing is to break from this notion that humanity has a firm grasp as to all ideas surrounding us.  I believe that the enlightenment agenda has failed.  The idea I am hoping to get at as well as instill is the novelty of ideas.  This falls in line with Gilles Deleuze in his work on What Is Philosophy? as well as in Whithead&rsquo;s Modes of Thought.  I will quote Whitehead here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of philosophy is to maintain an active novelty of fundamental ideas illuminating the social system.  It reverses the slow descent of accepted thought towards the inactive commonplace.  If you like to phrase it so, philosophy is mystical.  For mysticism is direct insight into depths as yet unspoken.  But the purpose of philosophy is to rationalize mysticism: not by explaining it away, but by the introduction of novel verbal charactertizations, rationally coordinated. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philosophy is akin to poetry, and both of them seek to express that ultimate good sense which we term civilization. In each case there is reference to form beyond the direct meanings of words.  Poetry allies itself to metre, philosophy to mathematic pattern. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The goal for both Whitehead and Deleuze in philosophy are the maintenance of ideas, and not in the argument If/then P (logic), but rather in the formation of possibilities that utilize the truth of logic for lure for feeling, thus the use of mysticism, poetry to express “civilization.”  It goes beyond the fact to value, to get lost in that which lures us.</p>
<p>I use philosophy as a center for discussing the other two facets, culture and religion.  If philosophy undergoes change, then it will be of interest as to how religion changes in light of the philosophical work of process and post-structuralist thought.</p>
