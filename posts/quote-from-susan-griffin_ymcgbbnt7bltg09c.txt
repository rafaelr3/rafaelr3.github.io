# quote from Susan griffin

> an older sense of participation in a world of meaning is traded for a mental world that, however dry and abstract, has the virtue of Independence.  To know is no longer erotic, no longer relational but becomes instead a means of escape from enmeshment in material existence.

~Susan Griffin, the Eros of everyday life, 85
