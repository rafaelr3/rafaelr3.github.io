# gaston bachelard, fragments of a poetics of fire, 7.

> An _idea_, in short, cannot be _imagined_... Ideas are invented only as correctives to the past...the poetic imagination for its part has no history at all.  It admits of no past preparation. The poetic image is truly the work of a spoken instant, an instant one will fail to grasp in the attempt to plot it against the untorn and untearable continuity of Bergsonian consciousness.  To pick up on all of the surprises in poetic language it is necessary that one give oneself over to kaleidoscopic consciousness.
