# notes on derrida, writing and difference

I'm in exam mode, and have been writing notes, or writing from the text.  I thought I would post here.  I have also written a piece to better understand, from my position, what Derrida is saying.  I will come back to it to reflect a bit more...after exams :-).

#### structure, sign and play

* the problem of the center of a structure.  the center as necessary to create the limits of play.  However, that center could not be substituted moved with something other.  The center is the center of a totality, yet the center does not belong to the totality, it is both inside and outside of it.  thus the center of the totality is elsewhere.  Derrida writes it is contradictory coherent, it joins things together, but that is not really the center, the thing that holds it all together.  There is no center.  Because it is a contradictory coherent, it always expresses a force of desire.
* The center is a play on a fundamental ground, an immobile and reassuring certitude.  This too is beyond the reach of play (ground, that is all that is).  So the center is a series of substitions of the center, thus the sign is a supplement for the sign, which is the supplement for a sign.
* The matrix for this is being as presence, center as being an arche, God, telos, energy, ousia, man
* the rupture that Derrida proposes is this: there never was a center, the center could not be thought in the form of a a present-being, that the center had no natural site, it was not a fixed locus, but a function, a sort of nonlocus in which an infinite number of sign-substitutions come into play.
* Everything becomes discourse, a system in whih the central signified, the original or transcendental signified, is never absolutely  present outside a system of differences.  The absence extends infinitely.
* the function of a bricolage is not like an engineer.  The myth of the engineer, that it breaks from every form and creates something new from new forms.  This goes against what Derrida says, in that because we rely on the metaphysics of presence, on terms that exist within a system, all we are doing are exchanging centers, that we cannot destroy the thing we want to destroy precisely because we need that which is there to destroy it.  Once we do away with that which we want to remove, we must remove the term that we used because it forms from the term we remove.
* The bricolage therefore builds from what it has, but plays with it.  There is no center, no subject, to a privileged reference or origin, no archia.  The bricoleur is always borrowing one’s concepts from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, so as well the discourse is a bricoleur.
* Since there is no center, what there remains are options, there are shadows and virtualities.  they are elusive, unactualizable.  No center means no subject, no author.  What remains are the myth and the music, which thrusts the audience as silent performers, looking at potentialities which are only shadows are actualized.  
* the nature of a field excludes totalization, example language.  The field is actually a play, a field of infinite substitutions only because it is finite, because there is something missing from it, a center.  Because there is no center, we substitute it, or it acts as a supplement in its absence

* In Artaud’s piece, Derrida looks at the desire of immediacy between word and action.  Artaud in his desire to not lose a word , discusses the theatre of the double.  Artuad does not want to be repetitive, to have no need of repetition.  However, for Artaud himself, he finds that once the words leave his mouth , they no longer belong to him, and he hears the I that is himself.  He finds his irreducible secondarity, his origin that is already eluded; for the origin is already eluded in that the space in which the speaker speaks seeks a place that is already missing.
* the structure of theft already lodges itself in the relation of speech to language.  Speech is stolen: since it is stolen from language it is, thus, stolen from itself.  Once speech leaves the I, it is already dislodged from the center, because I myself am substituting the center with myself, thus just left, and therefore the audience, the reader, becomes in a haunt the center and leaves as well.
* In here Derrida/Artaud (it is hard to know where one ends and the other begins) describes, in some way, God.  God is the proper name of that which deprives us of our own nature, of our own birth; He is the difference  which insinuates itself between myself and myself as my death. 

There are several pieces here that Derrida is performing.  He is repeating, albeit for a good reason, much of what he has done in previous or latter texts, that of difference, trace, questions on the origin, and the metaphysics of presence.  The problem for him has always been that the center is not really a center if it cannot be in play, affected by anything.  If the ground is ground and thus cannot be moved, changed, then there cannot be any universal.  Looked at in another way, there can never be a ground precisely because one cannot find it.  What they do find is difference/differance.  All there are are differences, things that have been excluded, different positions and possibilities.  If that is the case, than any judgement of things, are held in suspense, in pause, deferred.  That is the play on words Derrida has here.  We defer any judgements, and enter into the realm of a critique, a criticism, so that what is excluded comes out.  There is no originally, of which would be the center.  What we do find are centers of centers of centers, or signs of signs of signs.  Substitutions of the center at every moment, which develop a trace, a tracing of the different parts that make up what thing is.  What's more, there can never be no totality because of the impossibility of totalizing something.  That is because of the limits of language to capture the totalization of the said thing.  So what we enter into is a discourse of play.  It is a discourse of which words are decided upon, words that have been used in other spaces, but are being taken for this moment.  One becomes a bricoleur, some who builds from the resources around.  There is no new creation, no creatio ex nihilo, but a creatio ex profundis (to borrow Catherine Keller's term of creation as becoming, from the tehom).

Because of the realization that language cannot fully grasp the thing in discourse, it doesn't or should not lead to a giving up, a frustration, but rather a play.  I would say that it can be viewed from a theatre, or from the perspective of children at play.  In both instances we have the space in which the audience/children enter in, and they, not having rules (since the center is not really the center, but a sign of sign of sign)  begin to take of what is there and create.  This has the chance to provide great joy, or suffering.

The discussion on Artaud's God also proves interesting, as it discusses a form of God as view from scatology, God is excrement, the one which was me that I watch leaving me.  It is the realization that once something leaves me, it no longer really belongs to me, although it holds to something that is I.  It holds to the death of the author, the death of the self.  For Artaud, he desires a no-break from thought to speech, or thought to action, he does not desire repetition, precisely because repetition does not repeat the same.  Thus the one who takes away, who removes me from the self, that piece of shit, that he names as the name of God.  Artaud desires immediacy so much that he pushes it to its limits, and places the name of God as that which does not allow us to be truly what we are (the purity of the thought action).  Although this God is elusive, the one who separates me from myself, the one that escapes, this God is not a God of presence, but a ghost, always haunting, forcing me to repeat myself, recreate myself, articulate myself, whether in speech or in writing.

This is an ongoing process of thoughts, that have no beginning or end.  They are points that may help reverberate and create new concepts of the divine, on philosophy, on how we think.
