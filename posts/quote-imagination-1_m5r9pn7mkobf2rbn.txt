# quote: imagination

>To place "imagination" next to any word–to "desire," to "power"–is to charge it with a perceptible glow.  One now hears constant appeals to the imagination in the most diverse reaches of our culture, from the most recondite literary and cultural criticism to global advertising campaigns.  We read about passing our lives in "imagined communities" and we gaze at the single word "imagine" splayed across billboards and screens, as if it were the evident sum of desired meaning, while scholars of all descriptions yearn to be thought "imaginative"–and a throng of spiritual writers speak without conspicuous precision about the powers of the "religious imagination."
