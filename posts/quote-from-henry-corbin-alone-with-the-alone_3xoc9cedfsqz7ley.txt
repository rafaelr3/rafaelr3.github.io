## quote from henry corbin, alone with the alone

> The saying attributed to the Prophet: "Men are asleep, they awaken at their death," implies that everything human beings see in their earthly lives is of the same order as visions contemplated in dream.  The advantage of dreams over the positive data of waking life is that they permit, or rather require, an interpretation other than what is _disclosed_.  They _manifest_.

~Henry Corbin, Alone with the Alone (1969), 208.
