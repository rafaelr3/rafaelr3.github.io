# quote from alfred north whitehead, aims of education

> You may not divide the seamless coat of learning. What education has to impart is an intimate sense for the power of ideas, for the beauty of ideas, and for the structure of ideas, together with a particular body of knowledge which has peculiar reference to the life of the being possessing it. 
~(ANW, Aims of Education, pp. 11-12)
