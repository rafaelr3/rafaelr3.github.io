# rubem alves, tomorrow's child, 112, 114.

> Just as mice were conditioned to avoid pain by changing their location, so society conditions us to believe that our problems will be solved if we can jump the partition.  The affluent classes are those who have succeeded. But if the others only try hard enough, they will join the club.  The point is not to try to keep up with the Joneses, but to _be_ the Joneses.

> The game is complete. Nothing is lacking. Read the instructions carefully.  Use the right ingredients. Press the right buttons. The end-product will be the pleasure pie. If you do not succeed, try harder.
