# quote, rubem alves, tomorrow's child, 81.

> Those who enjoy power sense that things are under their control. They feel safe. Their heart has found satisfactions in things as they are, and as a consequence their consciousness has become adapted to the status quo. As we have seen their intention is not to abolish but to preserve "reality." This is the hidden secret of their realm: things must remain unchanged. When man feels, on the contrary, that his intentions are frustrated, and his desires repressed by the dominant order, of necessity a magical intention arises. Why?  Because of the very dynamics of consciousness. It must live in a world that makes sense. And a world that denies the aspirations of man as insane does not make sense.
