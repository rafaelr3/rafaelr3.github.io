# quote, rubem alves, tomorrow's child, 83.

> Magic is neither a theory of the omnipotence of thought nor of the omnipotence of desire. On the contrary, it is an acknowledgment that reality is not moved by our desires, _but that it ought to be_. It gives bodily form to what Ernst Bloch enunciated in the word: "What is, cannot be true." Facts are not values. Therefore facts themselves must be overcome.
