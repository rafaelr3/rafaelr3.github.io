# Critical Interpretation Seminar

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OOqzIrOvHX_HssDRnx6zTqbmh4NWtB2Z74tf2y7d7B8/edit?usp=sharing

**Course Description** - The Critical Interpretation Seminar is one of the three first-year seminars that students in all tracks of the Doctor of Ministry are required to complete. The seminar will make use of the philosophical and religious tools of the discipline of hermeneutics to organize its approach.  Hermeneutics can be broadly defined as the practice of interpretation of texts.  What is a text will be one of our initial key questions.  The seminar will start by looking at the performative dimensions of a text, with special attention to the manner in which reading, studying, and learning are performed human activities, or practices.  

To this end the seminar is designed to assist candidates over the first year of the Doctor of Ministry program: 

* to provide an opportunity to engage in critical and performative reflection and interpretation of texts and contexts, with special attention to the manner in which reflection and interpretation are a practice of ministry in community
* to assist in developing critical interpretive skills drawing upon several academic disciplines in a global urban context
* to explore the interrelationships of religious faith, experience, knowledge, analysis, and action that texts (including the text of oneâ€™s own life and the text of performed ministries) generate in a global urban context, that is, in the context of difference
* to experience personal and professional growth in a global urban context, working with instructor and fellow students as peers
