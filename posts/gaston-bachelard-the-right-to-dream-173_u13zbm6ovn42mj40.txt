# gaston bachelard, the right to dream, 173

> Whereas all other metaphysical experiences are prefaced by interminable preliminaries, poetry rejects preamble, principle, method or proof.  It rejects doubt. It does, however, demand a prelude of silence. First of all, by laying stress on words that are hollow, it silences all prose or song that would leave a continuity of thought or sound in the reader's mind. Then, after the empty sonorities, it produces its moment.  It is so that he can construct a complex moment and concentrate into that moment many simultaneities that the poet destroys the simple continuity of sequential time.
