> The dream is not an instrument.  It is not a *means*; it lives directly in the realm of *ends*.  It needs no intermediary to imagine the elements, but is a part of the elemental life.  In our dreams, we float without a boat, without a raft, without needing to hollow out a canoe from the trunk of a tree.  In the dream, tree trunks are always hollow.  They are always ready to envelop us and let us stretch out to sleep a long sleep after which we are sure of a youthful, vigorous awakening.
