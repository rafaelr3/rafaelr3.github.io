# rubem alves, tomorrow's child, 116.

> Futurology wants to describe how the future will be. It remains strictly within the limits of the reality principle. Prophecy and utopia, on the contrary, see the  future as a task. They want to "make room for the possible, as opposed to a passive acquiescence in the present state of affairs. It is symbolic thought which overcomes the natural inertia of man and endows him with a new ability. The ability constantly to reshape his human universe.
