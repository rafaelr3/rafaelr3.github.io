# quote from dale t. irvin, in "A Reform Amounting to a Revolution"


![](https://i.snap.as/Ln6lvmS.jpg)

> Too often theological education, driven by the perceived need to serve the status quo of existing churches and denominations rather than the wider world around it, has found its purpose in preparing managers and therapists for these congregations.  Religious leaders do need managerial skills, but these must be employed in ways that lead communities of faith in ways that empower them to experience transformation...Theological education should not be concerned only about training professional clerics, but should seek to energize and educate people more generally to prepare them for religious ministry and service in the world in which they live.
