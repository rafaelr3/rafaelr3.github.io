> Imagination is to society what dreams are to the individual.  In every utopia, in every work of art, in every religious fantasy and magic ritual, society is telling its hidden feelings.  It speaks of its frustrations and aspirations and unveils the repressed yearnings that cannot be articulated in common language. Like dreams, they seem meaningless at first glance. We try to arrive at their meaning through the logic of our common sense, and all we get is nonsense. We must find the key that unlocks their secret.
