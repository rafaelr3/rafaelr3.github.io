# quote, gaston bachelard, poetics of space, xvi

> the poetic image is not subject to an inner thrust. It is not an echo of the past. On the contrary: through the brilliance of an image, the distant past resounds with echoes, and it is hard to know at what depth these echos will reverberate and die way. Because of its novelty and action, the poetic image has an entity and a dynamism of its own; it is preferable to a direct _ontology_.
