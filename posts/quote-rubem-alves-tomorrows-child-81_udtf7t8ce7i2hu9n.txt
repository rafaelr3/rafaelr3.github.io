> Man performs magic because inside himself he has a magical intention: things as they are must be dissolved, and a new world, expressive of love, must take their place.  Without the magical intention, culture could not have been created.  For culture comes into being as a result of man's refusal to accept the world as it is, and as an expression of his utopian dream of creating an _ordo amoris_.
