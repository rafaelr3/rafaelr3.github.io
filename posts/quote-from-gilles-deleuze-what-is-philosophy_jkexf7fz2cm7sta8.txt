# quote from gilles deleuze "what is philosophy?"

>Creative fabulation has nothing to do with a memory, however exaggerated, or 'with a fantasy. In fact, the artist, including the novelist, goes beyond the perceptual states and affective transitions of the lived. The artist is a seer, a becomer. How would he recount what happened to him, or what he imagines, since he is a shadow? He has seen something in life that is too great, too unbearable also, and the mutual embrace of life with what threatens it, so that the corner of nature or districts of the town that he sees, along with their characters, accede to a vision that, through them, composes the percepts of that life, of that moment, shattering lived perceptions into a sort of cubism, a sort of simultaneism, of harsh or crepuscular light, of purple or blue, which have no other object or subject than them-selves. " What we call style's," said Giacometti, " are those visions fixed in time and space." It is always a question of freeing life wherever it is imprisoned, or of tempting it into an uncertain combat. ~p 171.

Notes:

* Reading on fabulation and how it is diverse from the role imagination plays.
* find it of interest of Deleuze' movement from perception to percept, affection to affect.  This move wrests the percept away from the subjective idealism which converts it to a perception.  The same with affect.
* Nevertheless, one needs to do something with it, thus the need for the subjective grasping, the passing through an ideal.
* I think I will look at how John Sallis rethinks the imagination through a gazing, and thus a tracing of the thing, the image, thereby shifting the moment from a subject to the object itself.
