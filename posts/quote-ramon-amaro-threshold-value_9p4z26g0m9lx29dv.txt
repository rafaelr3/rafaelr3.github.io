> Humans are not stable beings that function solely through pattern. Change itself is an act of life that sets and resets the conditions of individual human decision in a recurrent cycle of what Keeling argues is a becoming and unbecoming of the self. This self, however, does not exist in isolation. Our conditions are in parasitic dialogue with our own temporalities, as well as those of othersâ€”inclusive of the forces, structures, objects, and extraneous conditions that inform the now. Mathematics, although sophisticated and powerful, do not fully account for the actual variability of life. Mathematics can only represent life through the symbolic reduction of that which can be converted and quantified as a series of discrete or continuous variables.
