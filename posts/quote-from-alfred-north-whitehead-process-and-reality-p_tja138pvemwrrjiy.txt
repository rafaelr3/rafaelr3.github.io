# quote from alfred north whitehead, process and reality, p. 11

> A proposition can embody partial truth because it only demands a certain type of systematic environment, which is presupposed in its meaning.  It does not refer to the universe in detail.

~Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, 11.
