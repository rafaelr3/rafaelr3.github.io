# quote, gaston bachelard, air and dreams, 11.

> ...habit is the exact antithesis of the creative imagination. The habitual image obstructs imaginative powers.

As a note, this is far different than Bachelard's use of the motion of an image.  The habitual image is the image that comes from the same form, and thus the repetition is sameness.  Bachelard, like Nietzsche, seeks the images difference, and thus its motion.
