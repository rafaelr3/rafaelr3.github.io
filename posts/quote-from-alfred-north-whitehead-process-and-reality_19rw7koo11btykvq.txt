## quote from alfred north whitehead, process and reality

> we must investigate dispassionately what the metaphysical principles, here developed, require on these points, as to the nature of God.  There is nothing here in the nature of proof.  There is merely the confrontation of the theoretic system with a certain rendering of the facts...Any cogency of argument entirely depends upon elucidation of somewhat exceptional elements in our conscious experience--those elements which may roughly be classed together as religious and moral intuitions. ~343.
