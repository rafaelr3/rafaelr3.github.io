> It is necessary
for one who wants to
attain understanding
to raise the intellect
above the meaning of words
rather than to insist
upon their properties
which, in any case,
cannot be properly adapted
to such great mysteries

>Intellectual knowledge, alone and unaided,
desires and exaggerates
the victory of words

~Nicholas of Cusa
