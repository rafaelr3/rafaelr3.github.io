# making sense of augustine's trinity

I’ve been thinking about Augustine’s concept of the trinity, and trying to articulate in my head, and then explain it in a way that makes some sense.

* The Divine Nature is prior to the Persons/alities
* God is not God the Father, but the Trinity.
* The external operation of God (economic), is due to the whole trinity, and not solely of one person of the Godhead
* The son is begotten from God as an immanent act of the intellect (from immanent to economic)

For eastern theology[^1], God was to be known through the persons of the trinity, the begotten son who points to God the Father, and the Spirit, which proceeds from the Father, as something that has always been, and points back to both the begotten Son and the Father.  Jesus speaks that he will ask the Father, and the Father will send an Advocate.  It is in this threeness that one understands, through perichoresis, the intertwining of the distinctive persons in the Godhead, that we see in their essential nature one substance, one essence that makes them who they are.  They are one and three, with the distinctive persons showing and representing the one God.

But for Augustine it is different.  God doesn’t begin with God the Father, with the begotten Son afterwards, and then The Spirit proceeding from God the Father.  Rather God is Trinity, God is fathersonspirit.  There is no distinction in God’s essential nature, in God’s self.  It is in the economic space, the realm in which we exist and are in need of redemption that God as describe as the Father, Son and Spirit are emphasized.  The Son reveals the Father, and in his ministry, his act, he shows God, and that he is God.  In his act he reveals and gives the Spirit.  In this way, both in God’s essential and economic nature, in which I mean God’s way of communicating, and being, is both a distinction of three as well as a unitary act.  And this unitary act is the act of Love.  Augustine uses this as the central aspect of God.  God is love.  God acts in love.  Thus when we reflect on the Cross, we see Jesus; but we do not only see Jesus on the cross, we see and feel and hear “Look at the love of the father!,” not in the horrific act of death on the cross, but the symbol of sacrifice to redeem what has been lost, humanity, free will, true love, true relationship.  So for Augustine, God is in reality the Trinity, but acts in unity, unity of cause, unity of will, unity of purpose.
