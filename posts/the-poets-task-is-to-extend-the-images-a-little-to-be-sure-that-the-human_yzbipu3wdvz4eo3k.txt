> The Poet's task is to extend the images a little to be sure that the human quality of the mind is operating in them, to be sure that they are human images, images that humanize the forces of the cosmos.  Then we are led to a cosmology of what is human.  Instead of experiencing a naive anthropomorphism, we turn man over to elemental and deeply rooted forces.
