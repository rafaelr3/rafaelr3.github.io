# quote, gaston bachelard, poetics of space, xxiii.

> the reverberation, in spite of its derivative name, has a simple phenomenological nature in the domain of poetic imagination.  For it involves bringing about a veritable awakening of poetic creation, even in the soul of the reader, through the reverberation of a single poetic image. By its novelty, a poetic image sets in motion the entire linguistic mechanism.  The poetic image places us at the origin of the speaking being.
