# rubem alves, tomorrow's child, 117.

> In utopias we see the logic of creativity reaching its final limit. Long-held presuppositions must be given up. Only then can the new world begin. Nowhere is this so beautifully portrayed as in the biblical myth of creation. Myths of the beginning are actually a projected way of talking about the future one envisages. They are attempts to establish in the past, foundations for hopes of the future. They are dreams in which what is hoped for appears in the past tense. One must change the tense of the verb if one is to discover their meaning.
