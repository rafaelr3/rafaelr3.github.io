# quote, f. w. j. schelling

> _every_ meaning in mythology is merely potential, like in chaos, without therefore allowing itself to be limited or particularized. As soon as one attempts this, the appearance is deformed, even destroyed. If one permits the meaning to be as it is in it, and rejoices to himself about this infinity of possible relationships, then one has a proper attunement to grasp mythology.
