## move on
![](https://i.snap.as/qO4hcVq.jpg)

I struggle at times to write.  Battling  others and the ten books they have read, while I struggle to finish this one.  It is difficult at times.  

But then writing is cathartic, not as purifying, but in expressing what I feel.  It is not meant to purifying, but to accept the negation I feel within, that it is a part of me, and understanding why, maybe a bit jealous, envious.  But I move on, because it is not that.  It is because I feel that my voice, my expression will be lost.  I move on.
