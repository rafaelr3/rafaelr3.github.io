# quote from inner experience by georges bataille

>By *inner experience* I understand that which one usually calls *mystical experience*: the states of ecstasy, of rapture, at least of meditated emotion.  But I am thinking less of *confessional* experience, to which one has had to adhere up to now, than of an experience laid bare, free of ties, even of an origin, of any confession whatever....Inner experience responds to the necessity in which I find myself--human existence with me--of challenging everything (of putting everything into question) without permissable rest.  This necessity was at work despite religious beliefs, but it has even more far-reaching consequences if one does not have these beliefs.  Dogmatic presuppositions have provided experience with undue limits: he who already knows cannot go beyond a known horizon. ~George Batailles, Inner Experience, 3.
