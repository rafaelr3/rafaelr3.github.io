# quote from force of the imagination by john sallis

>...Imagination is monstrous, before all else, in that it configures in a profoundly monstrous way the very field of self-showing,installing monstrosity on the scene of what one would--even nonetheless--call natural appearances...imagination brings nonsense to intrude upon and become interior to sense, so that from sense there issues the self-showing of things.

~John Sallis, The Force of Imagination, 143.
