      <description> This cry for freedom seems at times to sleep for ages, like the fire in a volcano. When it wakes, the day of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment has arrived, and the worth of human societies is being weighted in His scales. Those societies perish which exhibit mainly selfishness and cowardice. Courage and hope are your best armour with which to meet a revolution&amp;ndash;and, above all, mutual sympathy.
