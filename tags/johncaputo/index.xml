      <description>I haven’t written a blog post in a bit, and wanted to at least throw out there what I am studying on, writing on.
Currently, I am reading Derrida, mainly two texts, The Insistence of God by Caputo, and Derrida and Theology by Shakespeare. They have been fascinating so far. I am amazed at the dillemma’s that Derrida is writing on, what he is trying to achieve, and how theologians are using it in their own work.</description>
