      <description>One of my main interests throughout my education has been trying to answer the question, “What is truth? What is ultimately true?” Now any reader may brush this off as not important, since we live in a postmodern/postcolonial world, but I would argue against that for various reasons. For simplicity I will hold to religion as my focal point; However, this can be used in any area: science, anthropology, sociology. All of these fields as well as many others can take hold of a primary position, making everything else subservient to it.</description>
