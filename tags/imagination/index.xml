      <description>Anselm classically defined theology as fides quarens intellectum&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;faith seeking understanding.&amp;rdquo; Not faith that already understands and so no longer needs to seek. That would by definition no longer be theology. Theology is not itself the faith but its quest. If we stop seeking, we are no longer on the way. Faith seeking understanding has then turned into &amp;ldquo;belief that understands.&amp;rdquo; It then closes the very root of quarens, from which come both question and quest.</description>

      <description> the quest for a New World in literature would be mere escapism if we did not feel that the text was reaching out beyond itself to something of &amp;lsquo;ultimate concern&amp;rsquo; to us. It would be mere fantasy if we did not sense that it was pointing to a mysterious reality which can only be hinted at.

      <description> In dominator culture the killing off of the imagination serves as a way to repress and contain everyone within the limits of the status quo.

      <description>Link to Aaron Cheak&amp;rsquo;s article is here.
I would like to thank Aaron Cheak for this wonderful translation from Henry Corbin. The selections get to the heart of Corbin&amp;rsquo;s understanding of alchemy. It resonates with the process of concrescence in Alfred North Whitehead. It breaks from any materialism and from any spiritualism. It seeks what Roland Faber writes as the intermezzo, the in-between. It is wholistic, in each different, with resonances when we relate with one another.</description>

      <description>violence does not participate in any order of reasons&amp;hellip;it denatures, wrecks, massacres that which it assaults&amp;hellip;it is not the stupidity that comes from a lack of intelligence, but much worse: it is the stupidity of le con. It is the calculated absence of thought willed by rigid intelligence.
 In the moments of peaceful protest due to the murder of George Floyd, among the many more African Americans that have died due to police violence, I reflect on the above quote as poignant and reveals to us the problem.</description>
