      <description>I am in the middle of writing my chapter on Imagination and the space of multiplicity, when I found this wonderful piece of translation and interpretation by Corbin, and had to add it here for rememberance. Here it goes:
&amp;ldquo;Seek Me in the Mystical Abode of Love &amp;quot; But, whoever dares to carry out this search will find himself obliged to defy the norms and forms of thought in the common, socialized forms of religion, and his proposals will sound like paradoxes (the shath of which Ruzbehan was so fond).</description>

      <description>One of my main interests throughout my education has been trying to answer the question, “What is truth? What is ultimately true?” Now any reader may brush this off as not important, since we live in a postmodern/postcolonial world, but I would argue against that for various reasons. For simplicity I will hold to religion as my focal point; However, this can be used in any area: science, anthropology, sociology. All of these fields as well as many others can take hold of a primary position, making everything else subservient to it.</description>
